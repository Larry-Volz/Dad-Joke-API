<h1>How the Web Works Exercises</h1>
<h2>Part One: Solidify Terminology</h2>
In your own terms, define the following terms: <br>

What is HTTP? <br>
- hypertext transfer protocol.  It is a markup language comprised of text that tells a browser what to display and how to act. <br>
What is a URL?<br>
- Universal Resource Locator - is a human-readable version of an IP address.  Tells a server what you want it to return to your browser <br>
What is DNS? <br>
- Domain Name Server - the system that translates a url into an ip address 
What is a query string? <br>
- a string that sends information to server in the form of a key and a value <br>
What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different? <br>
- GET and POST.  Get requests information of a server with no side-effects.  Post requests information but can also change the status of the server as well
What is an HTTP request? <br>
- requesting information of a server <br>
What is an HTTP response? <br>
- server returning information to the client - could be in the form of a web page
What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen. <br>
- A header is the information sent first when you communicate between server and client.   <br>
- request header comes from the client browser and includes such things as date and time, type of request (get or post), information on cookies and language preferences. <br>
- a response header answers with such things as date and time the server thinks it is, cookies it wants stored, response code (200, 300, 404, 500, etc.) and type of document
What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser? <br>
- the DNS system translates that into an IP address <br>
- a request is sent to the server usually in the form of a GET request <br>
- the server checks it's internal file system to see if it can grant the request - possibly using resources like a database along the way <br>
- server responds with either an error or a 200 code and sends the header and data (usually a website) back to the requesting computer to be displayed in the browser <br><br>
